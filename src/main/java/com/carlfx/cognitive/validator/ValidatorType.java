/**
 * This indicates an error global to a screen or field level error on an input form.
 * A validator type is whether the error occured for a field property or a global error.
 * For example: if a person view model contains a field called firstName
 * a validator is set up to validate that the field is required (not null and greater than 0 characters).
 * If the UI is wants to indicate messages beside the field they can.
 * For global error message there may be another way to display a coarse grain type error message such as duplicate
 * entity after saving a record.
